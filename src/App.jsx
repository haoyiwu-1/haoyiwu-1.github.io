                skill set and deepening my understanding of the tech industry. I
                hold an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which
                has equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithms, software
                development, and problem solving.

                In the past, I've contributed to two startups where I helped
                develop web applications integrated with AI technologies.

              This project involves big data analytics using Python on a single machine. The analytics were performed on a subset of Yelp's business, review, and user data. I developed four programs to analyze the dataset. The first program, descriptive-analytics.py, performs descriptive analytics on the dataset. The second program, frequency-distributions.py, computes useful frequency distributions from the data. The third program, social-network.py, creates a social network of Yelp friends from the data. The fourth and final program, network-analytics.py, performs basic network analytics on the constructed social network from the third program. For instructions on how to use and explore the programs, please refer to the GitHub link below.

Some pre-processing was required before the dataset could be used, along with other smaller details not mentioned here. The link below provides access to the source code, which can be run on Google Colab.

              This application was created for my software design class, where the goal was to implement a system based on a design  we developed using software design patterns. The front-end is basic, as the focus of the project was on software design, and time constraints limited its development. The app allows users to browse items in stores, and store managers and administrators to manage those stores. Without a requirement for a database, I used serialization and text files to simulate one. Input validation was not a focus, so reasonable inputs work best when exploring the app. The front-end was developed using Java Swing, with Java powering the back-end. I tested the application with JUnit test cases to cover all back-end functionality and identify potential bugs.
