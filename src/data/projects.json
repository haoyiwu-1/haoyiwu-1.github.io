I developed four programs to analyze the dataset. The first program, descriptive-analytics.py, performs descriptive analytics on the dataset. The second program, frequency-distributions.py, computes useful frequency distributions from the data. The third program, social-network.py, creates a social network of Yelp friends from the data. The fourth and final program, network-analytics.py, performs basic network analytics on the constructed social network from the third program. For instructions on how to use and explore the programs, please refer to the GitHub link below.",

    "description": "This application was created for my software design class, where the goal was to implement a system based on a design  we developed using software design patterns. The front-end is basic, as the focus of the project was on software design, and time constraints limited its development. The app allows users to browse items in stores, and store managers and administrators to manage those stores. Without a requirement for a database, I used serialization and text files to simulate one. Input validation was not a focus, so reasonable inputs work best when exploring the app. The front-end was developed using Java Swing, with Java powering the back-end. I tested the application with JUnit test cases to cover all back-end functionality and identify potential bugs.",
